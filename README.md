English translation (top-left): A number of postings on abandoned animal adoption often feature images of incapacitated dogs and cats turning their backs in fear. However, in the high quality images of abandoned animals posted by the Pohang City Animal Protection Center (Korea), animals are smiling brightly. Because the photos can determine whether the abandoned animal gets adopted or being euthanized, the staff members put a lot of efforts to take as best pictures as they can. 
Thanks to the efforts of the staff members, the adoption rate has sparked significantly. However, the adoption dissolution rate has also increased due to people who have made their decisions impulsively based on a single photo of an animal. What efforts does the society as a whole need in order to avoid putting these animals into a even deeper misery due to adoption dissolution?    
English translation (top-right): The following is part of an interview about the songwriting composition of *Through the night*, one of the representative songs of artist IU.

"Sleep is so precious to me. Sleep is so precious and so important that it's one of my favorite things. But I missed him so much at night. I can call him and say, "I miss you" or "I love you," but it's too late to wake him up. Because I love this person, his sleep is more precious. Rather than saying, "I like you," to the man who is already asleep, "I want you to have a good night's sleep by sending a firefly to watch your window. Come to think of it, I think it's love." He confessed.
The warm light that's so small that it doesn't wake me up, but it's obviously a firefly."

I think that the attitude of caring about each other's situation can be applied not only to love between men and women, but also to love such forms as friendship and family love. Like the firefly in the night letter, how can you express your love and care for someone in one symbolic word?

English translation (bottom-right): 2005년 3월 경 인간극장 채널에서, 노숙자 분들에게 매일 따뜻한 밥 한 끼를 대접하는 "민들레 국수집"편이 방영되었어요. 국수집 간판을 달았지만 손님들이 허기질까 걱정되어 국수 대신 밥과 맛있는 반찬을 담아 무료로 제공하고 있다고 해요. 식사만 대접하는 것이 아니라, 항상 온화하게 웃는 얼굴로 손님들의 근황도 살필 뿐만 아니라 다시 건강한 삶을 유지할 수 있도록 도움을 주기도 한답니다!
현재에는 코로나 바이러스 때문에 굶고 계신 손님들을 위해 도시락을 만들어 나누어 주고 계시다고 해요. 그렇다면 우리는 일상생활 속에서 어떻게 사소한 나눔을 실천해나갈 수 있을까요? 다시 돌려받는 것을 바라지 않는 청아한 마음을 갖기 위해서는 어떤 자세와 관점이 필요할까요?
